# Keras-Tensorflow
Ready to use docker images for Keras and tensorflow as backend
 
# Notice
This repository is not being updated anymore, as the source repository contains files larger than githubs allowed filesize limit. The files in question are compiled tensorflow wheels with specific cuda versions and processor flags, which are not part of the official binaries anymore. You can find the original repository [here](https://git.chemsorly.com/Docker/Keras-Tensorflow)
